# Understanding the Gender Gap based on College Degrees
My goal for this project is to analyse understanding the gender gap in college majors based on the job outcomes of the students who graduated from college in the USA between 2010 and 2012. The data, which is provided from American Community Survey is cleaned and released by FiveThirtyEight on their Github repo. This is my second project on the Data Science Path in dataquest.io, where I focus on data visualisation techniques.

I am going to divide the analysis in two parts:

1. Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors, where I will visualise the gender pay gap focusing on the STEM degrees and generate bar charts for a better understanding.
2. Visualizing The Gender Gap In College Degrees, where I will compare all degree categories and generate line charts for better readability.

Based on the data provided by this dataset I will try to explore some questions using different visualisation techniques, such as:
- I will use **scatter plots** to understand whether students in more popular majors make more money or not.
- Using **histograms** I will examine how many majors are predominantly male and redominantly female.
- With the help of **bar plots** I will analyse which category of majors have the most students.
